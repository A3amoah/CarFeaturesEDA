# CarFeaturesEDA
Car Features Dataset
The data contains  10, 000 rows and more than 10 columns which contains features of the car such as Engine Fuel Type, Engine HP, Transmission Type, highway MPG, city MPG and many more.
The EDA steps done on this dataset are as follows:
#load libraries
#Load data from the csv file
#check the data types
#Dropping irrelevant columns
#Renaming the columns
#check the shape of the dataset(columns,rows)
#check the number of duplicate rows and dropping them
#check for the sum of null values and replacing/dropping them
#Checling for outliers.Using  IQR score technique to remove them
#An outlier is a point or set of points that are different from other points. Sometimes they can be very high or very low
#Finally generating a few plots to show the relation between variables
